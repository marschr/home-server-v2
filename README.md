# Home Server v2

A modernized GNOME Shell extension for monitoring and waking your home server with GNOME 45+ support. Migrated from the original Home-Server by Sven Kramer (extension UUID: Home-Server@sven.kramer, https://www.sven-kramer.eu).

> **Note:** This extension requires the `wakeonlan` dependency to function properly.

To install `wakeonlan` on Ubuntu 24.04, run the following command:
```bash
sudo apt install -y wakeonlan
```
